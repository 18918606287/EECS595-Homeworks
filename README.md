# EECS595-Homeworks
My own homework solutions of EECS595, Natural Language Processing.

## Homeworks List
+ **Homework 1** Part of Speech tagging based on Hidden Markov Model on part of Penn Treebank dataset.

## Homework 1
### Input
The file `model.pyc` is the complie file of pre-trained HMM model generated by `train.py` using part of Penn Treebank dataset. The file `pos.py` is the main py file. Run `pos.py` in command line
```bash
python pos.py testing_filename testing_with_labels
```
Where `testing_filename` is the name of test set document and `testing_with_labels` is the name of test set ***with labels after the words including pounctuations***. For example, `Hello UH World NN . .`. Both of documents should be on the root directory.

### Output
There is a simple output on terminal of accuracy on your test set.
```bash
The accuracy is 92.29%.
